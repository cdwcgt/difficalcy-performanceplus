# difficalcy-performanceplus

This is a [difficalcy](https://github.com/Syriiin/difficalcy) calculator for the PP+ (PerformancePlus) algorithm.

The core PP+ algorithm was originally developed by [Drezi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3936645) as part of the [PP+ project](https://syrin.me/pp+/).

Later, with Drezi's permission, I ([Syrin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5701575)) [ported the algorithm to lazer](https://github.com/Syriiin/osu/tree/performanceplus) to release it open source.

This project can be used to run the PP+ calculator easily within your own projects.

## Basic usage

Run the server:

```sh
docker run -p 5000:80 ghcr.io/syriiin/difficalcy-performanceplus:latest
```

Call the API:

```sh
curl "localhost:5000/api/calculation?BeatmapId=658127"
```

Get your lazer powered calculations:
